      <description>This article is written by Gemini Deep Research.
Introduction In the rapidly evolving landscape of product development, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices have become integral to enhancing efficiency and collaboration. This has led many to explore the applicability of DevOps and MLOps methodologies beyond traditional software and machine learning projects. A pressing question in this realm is:
Can DevOps and MLOps methodologies be applied to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE)?</description>

      <description>DASSL: A Deep Dive into Implementation and Performance Variations in Dymola and OpenModelica DASSL (Differential/Algebraic System Solver) is a numerical algorithm widely used for solving differential/algebraic equations (DAEs). These equations arise in various scientific and engineering domains, including modeling physical systems, chemical reactions, and control systems. DASSL&amp;rsquo;s ability to handle both ODEs and DAEs makes it a versatile tool for simulating complex systems. While DASSL&amp;rsquo;s core algorithm remains consistent, its</description>
