<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>The automotive industry is undergoing a revolution, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) at the forefront of this transformation. As BEVs gain traction, the demand for high-performance, safe, and long-lasting batteries has surged. These batteries are some of the best current technologies for vehicle operation, offering significant advantages over traditional internal combustion engines1. However, developing such advanced battery technology presents numerous challenges, including achieving range parity with conventional vehicles. Range parity refers to the ability of BEVs to travel a comparable distance on a single charge as gasoline-powered vehicles with a full tank1.</p>
<p>Battery simulation technology has emerged as a critical tool in addressing these challenges. By enabling engineers to design, analyze, and optimize battery systems in a virtual environment, simulation significantly reduces development time and costs. This is achieved by minimizing the reliance on expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes, allowing for rapid iteration and exploration of different design options2. This report provides a comprehensive overview of BEV battery simulation technology, encompassing its classification, limitations, and applications in the automotive industry.</p>
