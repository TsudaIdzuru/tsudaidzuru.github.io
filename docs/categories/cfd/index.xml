      <description>Introduction In the rapidly evolving landscape of product development, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices have become integral to enhancing efficiency and collaboration. This has led many to explore the applicability of DevOps and MLOps methodologies beyond traditional software and machine learning projects. A pressing question in this realm is:&#xA;Can DevOps and MLOps methodologies be applied to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE)?&#xA;I am interested in continuously and efficiently comparing data, simulation results, and actual machine experiments within the manufacturerâ€™s development department.</description>
