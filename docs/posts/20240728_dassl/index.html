[8.9, 8.10] in spite of its inefficiency when dealing with non-stiff problems due to the relatively large error coefficients of the BDF formulae, and in spite of its inefficiency when dealing with highly nonlinear problems that require frequent step-size adjustment, such as those that we shall look at in Chapter 9 of this book.</p>
