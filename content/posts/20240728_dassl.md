> DASSL is one of the most successful simulation codes on the market today. It implements the BDF formulae of orders one to five in their DAE format, as presented earlier in this chapter. DASSL is a variable-step, variable- order code that uses order buildup during the startup period. The code was written by Linda Petzold [8.4, 8.34].

> The code has meanwhile been made the default simulator in Dymola. [8.9, 8.10] in spite of its inefficiency when dealing with non-stiff problems due to the relatively large error coefficients of the BDF formulae, and in spite of its inefficiency when dealing with highly nonlinear problems that require frequent step-size adjustment, such as those that we shall look at in Chapter 9 of this book.
