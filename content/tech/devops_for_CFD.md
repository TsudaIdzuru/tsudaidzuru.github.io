## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of product development, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices have become integral to enhancing efficiency and collaboration. This has led many to explore the applicability of DevOps and MLOps methodologies beyond traditional software and machine learning projects. A pressing question in this realm is:

> **Can DevOps and MLOps methodologies be applied to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE)?**  
> *I am interested in continuously and efficiently comparing data, simulation results, and actual machine experiments within the manufacturer’s development department. While CAE and CFD require substantial computational resources, unlike machine learning projects, they necessitate the creation of computational meshes and the processing of CAD data. Therefore, the MLOps approach cannot be directly applied to CAE or CFD as it is currently implemented. Are there any examples of companies that have successfully implemented DevOps and MLOps methodologies in conjunction with CAE or CFD? Specifically, I am interested in learning about large companies with a high demand for CAE, such as Toyota and Volkswagen, and how they have managed to leverage DevOps and MLOps to enhance their CAE workflows.**

To address this inquiry, a comprehensive report delves into the integration of DevOps and MLOps within CAE and CFD workflows, highlighting benefits, challenges, and real-world applications.

## DevOps and MLOps for CFD and CAE: A Deep Dive

The global Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) market is witnessing significant growth, projected to reach nearly $11,251.71 million by 2027 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.64%[^1]. This surge is driven by the escalating demand for simulation-driven product development across diverse industries such as automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing. CAE technologies, including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA), empower engineers to model and analyze complex systems, optimize designs, and predict product behavior prior to the creation of physical prototypes.

### The Role of DevOps and MLOps

As simulations grow more complex and iteration cycles become faster, efficient workflows become paramount. DevOps, a blend of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and deliver continuous delivery with high software quality[^3]. MLOps extends these principles to the machine learning lifecycle, encompassing data preparation, model development, deployment, and monitoring[^4]. While traditionally associated with machine learning, the principles of MLOps can be adapted to enhance CFD and CAE workflows.

### Accessibility of High-Performance Computing (HPC)

The rise of cloud computing and container technologies has significantly increased the accessibility of High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources[^2]. Cloud-based HPC solutions eliminate the necessity for costly hardware and software investments, enabling even smaller companies to harness the power of CAE and CFD. This democratization underscores the importance of efficient workflows and methodologies like DevOps and MLOps to manage and optimize these resources effectively.

## DevOps for CAE

Implementing DevOps practices within CAE can lead to improved collaboration, automated workflows, and accelerated simulation processes. Key applications include:

### Version Control for CAE Models

Utilizing version control systems such as Git allows for tracking changes to simulation models, input files, and results. This practice ensures reproducibility, facilitates collaboration, and enables easy rollback to previous versions when necessary[^3].

### Continuous Integration for Simulation Workflows

Automating the build and execution of simulations through continuous integration enables engineers to swiftly identify and rectify errors, ensuring that only validated models proceed to further analysis. Platforms like Azure DevOps offer robust support for implementing continuous integration in CAE environments[^3].

### Automated Testing in CAE

Automated testing frameworks validate simulation results against predefined criteria, ensuring accuracy and reliability[^6]. This encompasses unit tests for individual components, integration tests for component interactions, and system-level tests for overall simulation behavior.

### Continuous Deployment of CAE Results

Automating the deployment of simulation models and results to stakeholders accelerates decision-making and reduces time-to-market[^6]. This may involve generating and distributing reports, visualizations, and other relevant documentation to engineers, designers, and decision-makers.

### Application Mocks in CAE

Companies like DocuSign employ application mocks to simulate real-world scenarios and test their CAE applications in controlled environments[^7]. This approach allows for thorough testing and validation of simulation models before deployment, mitigating the risk of errors and enhancing result reliability.

**Key Insight:** Continuous monitoring and feedback are crucial in DevOps for CAE. Monitoring simulation performance and gathering stakeholder feedback enable engineers to identify and address issues early, resulting in significant cost and time savings[^6].

## MLOps for CFD

Although MLOps cannot be directly applied to CFD as it is for machine learning projects, its principles can be tailored to address specific CFD workflow challenges:

### Data Management in CFD

MLOps tools facilitate the management and versioning of extensive CFD datasets, including simulation results, experimental data, and CAD models. This ensures data integrity and promotes efficient data sharing and collaboration[^9][^10]. Tools like MLflow and DVC offer functionalities for data versioning, tracking, and management, fostering reproducibility in CFD projects.

### Pipeline Automation for CFD Workflows

Adapting MLOps pipelines to automate CFD workflows—such as mesh generation, solver execution, and post-processing—can significantly reduce manual efforts and expedite simulation turnaround times[^11].

### Model Versioning in CFD

Tracking different versions of CFD models and their parameters using MLOps tools ensures reproducibility and facilitates model comparison and optimization[^9].

### Monitoring and Optimization of CFD Simulations

MLOps monitoring tools can track CFD simulation performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize resource allocation[^11].

### Addressing MLOps Challenges in CFD

Applying MLOps to CFD introduces unique challenges, including inefficiencies in existing tools and infrastructure for managing CFD simulations[^12], and inadequate model versioning capabilities for CFD models, which can impede reproducibility and collaboration[^12].

### NVIDIA Modulus for CFD

NVIDIA Modulus, an open-source framework, is designed for building, training, and fine-tuning physics-informed machine learning models for CFD simulations[^13]. It offers optimized implementations of various ML algorithms, enabling the creation of AI surrogates that augment traditional numerical simulations, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency.

**Key Insight:** Scaling MLOps for CFD workflows is challenging due to the complexity of CFD data and the substantial computational resources required[^14]. Effective data management, efficient pipeline automation, and robust model versioning are essential for overcoming these challenges and ensuring scalability.
